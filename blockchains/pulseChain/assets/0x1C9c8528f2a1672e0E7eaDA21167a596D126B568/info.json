    "description": "MOONX on PulseChain is likely the ticker for the MoonX token, associated with the MetaTreasure project, which aims to integrate on-chain advertising and tap-to-earn mechanisms into its ecosystem. It appears to be a utility token designed to power features like Tap-to-Earn, and it also involves deflationary tokenomics through its 'burn' mechanism.",
